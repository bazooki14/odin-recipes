This project will be demonstrating my current (09/09/2022) understanding of HTML that I have developed through lessons from The Odin Project. 

Completion of this project demonstrates my ability to create a basic website with linked webpages in HTML. Elements used in this project include: the components of the HTML boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.
